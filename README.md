# Sorting-Algorithms
Algorithm | Time Complexity (Avg / Worst) | Runtime (ms)* | Remarks
Insertion Sort | O(n²) / O(n²) | 420 ms | Slow on large datasets, but simple to write
Counting Sort | O(n + k) / O(n + k) | 6 ms | Fastest for integers in small ranges
Bubble Sort | O(n²) / O(n²) | 700 ms | Inefficient for large inputs
Quick Sort | O(n log n) / O(n²) | 12 ms | Very fast on average, but not stable
Merge Sort | O(n log n) / O(n log n) | 15 ms | Consistent and stable
