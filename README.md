# Sorting-Algorithms
# Algorithm | Time Complexity (Avg / Worst) | Runtime (ms)* | Analysis

Insertion Sort | O(n²) / O(n²) | 420 ms | Slow on large datasets, but simple to write

Counting Sort | O(n + k) / O(n + k) | 6 ms | Fastest for integers in small ranges

# How to run

First time running the program, you must generate the list of random numbers (3) which then uploads the list to "data.txt"
Next, you can either exit (8) the program to observe the contents of the file, or continue to one of the sorting algorithms (1 or 2)
Once the algorithm is ran, the sorted contents are then uploaded to its own file (seperate from the data.txt file)
